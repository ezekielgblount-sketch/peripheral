# Agent Log

Running record of what Claude did in each work session, in reverse-chronological
order (newest first). Written so either human can read a session's entry, look at
the diff, and decide whether to push — without needing to have watched the stream.

Convention: Claude commits locally with a clear message. **Pushing is a separate,
human decision** — read the entry below, check `git log` / `git diff`, then push
if it looks right.

## Session — 2026-08-09

**Did:**
- Added `unreal/` scaffolding: `.gitattributes` (LFS rules for future binary
  assets), UE5-specific `.gitignore` entries, `CLAUDE.md` (units conversion,
  UE5 post-process defaults that violate the art direction, anomaly state
  machine architecture).
- Confirmed UE 5.8 installed at `X:\UE_5.8`.

**Pushed:** yes — commit `9d3b241`, scaffolding only, no engine-generated files.

**Next:** create the First Person Blueprint project in `unreal/`, enable the
Unreal MCP plugin + All Toolsets, verify MCP with a read-only session before any
write actions.
